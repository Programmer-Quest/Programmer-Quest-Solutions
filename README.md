# Programmer Quest Solutions

This repository contains example solutions to the programming challenges on the website [Programmer Quest](http://programmerquest.com/).
The solutions are written in C++ and can all be compiled on the command line. For challenges that has an input file, the solution expects it from standard in,
so for example the very first solution can be compiled and run with the following line:

```
g++ --pedantic -Wall -Wextra -g -std=c++20 pX/pX.cpp && ./a.out < <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE>
```

Where X is replaced by the problem index and \<PATH\_TO\_INPUT\_FILE\> is the path to the input for that particular problem.
